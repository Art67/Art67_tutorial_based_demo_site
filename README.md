Art67 - Tutorial-based demo website

This website was built as part of a tutorial offered by Development Island. I've made small changes (e.g. creating the symbols banner), but the design, layout and text mostly conform with preset specifications as this one-page website was intended as an exercise. We were encouraged to assign the copyright to our own names, but, in fact, the idea, basic design, code and text belong to Development Island.
However, I used the idea and code behind this exercise as a basis for building my next demo website, 'The Everyday Scientist', URL https://art67.github.io/.
